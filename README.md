  - Handles the "heathy" typo in folder names
  - Copies all PNG files while maintaining folder hierarchy
  - Provides detailed progress tracking and error handling

### 16. `flatten_crc_structure.py`
**Purpose:** Flatten the deep nested CRC folder structure in Processed directory
- **Features:**
  - Removes duplicate folder names (e.g., 240911_CRC/240911_CRC ‚Üí 240911_CRC)
  - Removes the "images" subfolder and moves files up one level
  - Handles filename conflicts with automatic renaming
  - Cleans up empty directories after flattening
  - Works on both healthy and tumour directories

### 17. `count_png_files.py`
**Purpose:** Count PNG files in both original PNG_Files and Processed directories

## File Structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Convert raw data/          # Original data directory
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PNG_Files/                # Separated PNG files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ *.py                      # Processing scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore               # Git ignore rules
